## A repo for Markdown: _I'm having fun_


**[Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/)** is a collection of fancy mark ups for text, which is widely used on many text-based sites and applications in some form or another. Such applications include Google Drive and Microsoft Word (the former of which is *superior*). While the use is not 1:1, similar ideas are seen on the sites and applications as are in **Markdown**. 
> While the use is not 1:1

Sites use their own verson of fancy text with its own operators.
Google Docs uses... 
* <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + i for *italics*
* ctrl + b for **bold**
* ctrl + u for underline
* etc...
