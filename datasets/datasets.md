Project: ~80 MB per FY, from 1985 to today, XML, CSV.
Abstract: ~50 MB per FY, from 1985 to today, XML, CSV.
Publication: ~20 MB per FY, from 1980 to today, XML, CSV.
Patent: 2MB for all FY, only CSV.
Clinical Studies: 1MB for all FY, only CSV.
Link Tables: ~3MB per FY, XML, CSV.

The information found in RePORTER is drawn from several extant databases–eRA databases, Medline, PubMed Central, the NIH Intramural Database, and iEdison–using newly-formed linkages among these disparate data sources. The comprehensiveness of these databases varies, as does the quality of the linkages formed among them. We expect that the quality of RePORTER data will improve over time as a result of changes in both data collection (e.g., implementation of the NIH Public Access policy) and the increased ability to identify missing information that comes from making these data accessible to members of the public.
